**packetPunk** is an arduino sketch from the **dstike esp32 watch devkit**, an ESP32 microcontroller with an OLED display, a NeoPixel, flashlight, buzzer, battery, charging circuit, SD card slot, and a few buttons.

The application listens to incoming OSC messages on port 9000, and when in recording mode, writes these messages to SD card with timestamps for easy playback.

I use it with the supberb iOS application [gyrosc](https://www.bitshapesoftware.com/instruments/gyrosc/) but it should work with any application capable of sending OSC.


### usage
- Follow onscreen instructions to connect to network (password is packetPunk)
- OSC messages are received on port 9000.
- Press the top left button to start logging, press again to save file.
- Long-press  bottom left button to disconnect from current WiFi network.
- If you need to manage saved networks use [this sketch](https://github.com/Hieromon/AutoConnect/blob/master/examples/Credential/Credential.ino).

Example log playback patches for Max and Pure Data included.
